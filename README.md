# Front-End Developer Code Challenge

Thanks so much for your interest in working at SIDEARM Sports as a Front-End Developer! Below is a test project we'd like to have you do. The purpose of this is to see how you would accomplish some of our most common layouts that we use on a vast majority of our sites.

# Brief

Building layouts provided by designer mockups is a big part of our day to day at SIDEARM Sports. For this coding challenge, you'll be building a set of different layouts to show that you understand what a responsive website is.

## Figma

At SIDEARM Sports, we use Figma both to prototype ideas & create high-fidelity UI designs.

Please find below the Figma file for this coding challenge. [https://www.figma.com/file/nsA0rvuI8PxoIgsikJcj57/Candidate-mock](https://www.figma.com/file/nsA0rvuI8PxoIgsikJcj57/Candidate-mock). The font being used is [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)

## Assumptions

- Aim for an end-result that you'd be comfortable to ship to real-world users
- Write the code as if you'd have to maintain it for the years to come

## Questions

*We'd love to get your thoughts on each of these (no more than a few minutes per point).*

1. What are some edge-cases you'd consider before shipping this feature?
2. Which of your skills that you expect to use in this role do you feel *weren't* highlighted in this project?
3. What's important for remote engineering teams to work well?
